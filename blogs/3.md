# React Tutorial: Understanding the useRef Hook

The `useRef` hook is a useful feature of React that allows you to reference DOM elements or values that persist across component renders. In this tutorial, we'll explore what the `useRef` hook is and how to use it in your React applications.

## What is the useRef Hook?

The `useRef` hook is a function provided by React that allows you to create a mutable reference that persists across component renders. You can use this reference to reference DOM elements, store values, or persist values across renders.

## How to Use the useRef Hook

Let's take a look at an example of how to use the `useRef` hook in a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Focus Input
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we're importing the `useRef` hook from the React library. We're defining a functional component called `Example` and initializing a mutable reference using the `useRef` hook.

We're then creating an input element and setting its reference to the `inputRef` variable using the `ref` attribute.

We're also defining a `handleClick` function that will be called when the button is clicked. Inside this function, we're calling the `focus` method on the input element using the `current` property of the `inputRef`.

Finally, we're rendering the input element and a button that will focus the input element when clicked.

## Conclusion

The `useRef` hook is a powerful feature of React that allows you to create a mutable reference that persists across component renders. With this hook, you can reference DOM elements, store values, or persist values across renders.

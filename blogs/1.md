# React Tutorial: Understanding the useState Hook

If you're just getting started with React, you may have heard about the `useState` hook. In this tutorial, we'll explore what the `useState` hook is and how to use it in your React applications.

## What is the useState Hook?

The `useState` hook is a function provided by React that allows you to add state to your functional components. Prior to the introduction of hooks, state could only be managed in class components using the `setState` method.

With the `useState` hook, you can now define state in a functional component and update it using the `setState` function that's returned by the hook. This makes it easier to manage state in your application without the need for class components.

## How to Use the useState Hook

Let's take a look at an example of how to use the `useState` hook in a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we're importing the `useState` hook from the React library. We're then defining a functional component called `Example`. Inside the component, we're defining a state variable called `count` using the `useState` hook. We're initializing the state variable to `0`.

The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements. The first element is the current value of the state variable (`count` in this case) and the second element is a function to update the state (`setCount` in this case).

We're then rendering the current value of `count` inside a paragraph element and a button that will update the state variable when clicked.

When the button is clicked, the `setCount` function is called with the updated value of `count`. This causes React to re-render the component with the new value of `count`.

## Conclusion

The `useState` hook is a powerful feature of React that allows you to manage state in your functional components. With this hook, you can easily define and update state without the need for class components.

# React Tutorial: Understanding the useEffect Hook

In React, the `useEffect` hook is a powerful feature that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. In this tutorial, we'll explore what the `useEffect` hook is and how to use it in your React applications.

## What is the useEffect Hook?

The `useEffect` hook is a function provided by React that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. Side effects are actions that are performed outside of the normal flow of your application, such as making an API call or updating the browser's title.

The `useEffect` hook is called after every render of your component and is typically used to perform cleanup or update state based on changes to props or state.

## How to Use the useEffect Hook

Let's take a look at an example of how to use the `useEffect` hook in a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we're importing the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. We're defining a functional component called `Example` and initializing a state variable called `count` to `0` using the `useState` hook.

We're then using the `useEffect` hook to update the browser's title with the current value of `count`. The `useEffect` hook takes a function as its first argument, which will be executed after every render of the component.

Inside the function passed to `useEffect`, we're updating the browser's title using the `document.title` property. We're interpolating the value of `count` into the title string using template literals.

Finally, we're rendering the current value of `count` inside a paragraph element and a button that will update the state variable when clicked.

## Conclusion

The `useEffect` hook is a powerful feature of React that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. With this hook, you can easily perform cleanup or update state based on changes to props or state.
